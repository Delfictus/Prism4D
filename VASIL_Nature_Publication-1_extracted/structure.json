A plausible hypothesis proposes that the virus evolves to evade antibody-\nmediated neutralization (vaccine- or infection-induced) to maximize its ability to\ninfect an immunologically experienced population1,3. Because viral infection induces\nneutralizing antibodies, viral evolution may thus navigate on a dynamic immune\nlandscape that is shaped by local infection history. Here we developed a comprehensive\nmechanistic model, incorporating deep mutational scanning data4,5, antibody\npharmacokinetics and regional genomic surveillance data, to predict the variant-\nspecific relative number of susceptible individuals over time.
