# CryptoSite Benchmark - Ground Truth
# Format: apo_pdb,holo_pdb,protein_name,cryptic_residues,site_description,difficulty
#
# Difficulty levels:
#   easy   = pocket partially visible in apo
#   medium = pocket barely visible in apo  
#   hard   = pocket completely absent in apo
#
# cryptic_residues = residues that form the cryptic site (comma-separated)
