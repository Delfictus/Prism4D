# ⚠️ OPTIMIZATION NOTES:
# 1. This config targets 30-40 conflicts in Phase 3 (down from 70)
# 2. If still getting >40 conflicts, increase max_colors to 20
# 3. For <20 final colors, increase μ to 0.75 in thermodynamic.cu
# 4. Runtime: ~15s per attempt (50% increase from current)
# 5. Recommended: Run 100-1000 attempts for statistical significance
