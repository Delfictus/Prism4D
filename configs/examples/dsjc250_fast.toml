# PRISM Fast Memetic Configuration for DSJC250.5
#
# Optimization: Phase 2 iterations reduced from 10K → 5K for 2x speedup
#
# Expected Performance:
# - Per-attempt GPU time: ~12s (down from ~24s)
# - 256 attempts in ~51 minutes (instead of 102 minutes)
# - Trade-off: May produce 42-color baseline (vs 41), but faster iteration
#
# Usage:
#   ./prism-cli --input benchmarks/dimacs/DSJC250.5.col --gpu --attempts 256 --config configs/dsjc250_fast.toml
