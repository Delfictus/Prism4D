# Run 5: Hybrid Configuration - Best of Run 2 + Run 4
#
# Strategy: Combine Run 2's successful Phase 2 temperature range with
# Run 4's enhanced memetic parameters to attempt beating 39-color baseline.
#
# Hypothesis: Run 2's 38-color result may be reproducible with enhanced
# memetic evolution providing deeper exploitation of the search space.
#
# Phase 2 Profile (from Run 2):
# - iterations=10000: Full annealing depth
# - replicas=8: Run 2's baseline (vs Run 4's 10)
# - temp_min=0.01: Run 2's higher floor (vs Run 4's 0.0005)
# - temp_max=10.0: Run 2's wider range (vs Run 4's 8.0)
# - Rationale: Run 2 achieved 38 colors with this profile
#
# Memetic Enhanced Profile (from Run 4):
# - mutation_rate=0.07: +17% vs Run 2's 0.06
# - local_search=200: +33% vs Run 2's 150
# - Rationale: Deeper search without changing GPU baseline diversity
#
# Expected Outcomes:
# 1. GPU baselines: Likely still 41 colors (consistent pattern)
# 2. Target: Match or beat Run 2's 38 colors via enhanced memetic
# 3. Runtime: ~6.5 hours (256 attempts at ~92s each + memetic)
# 4. Test: Does memetic enhancement compensate for temp range?
