# Run 3: Fast Phase 2 + Enhanced Memetic (512 attempts)
#
# Strategy: Reduce Phase 2 iterations for speed (6K vs 10K) while maintaining
# enhanced memetic parameters to test if faster GPU population generation
# improves memetic starting diversity
#
# Changes from Run 2:
# - Phase 2: iterations 10000 → 6000 (40% reduction, ~14s vs ~24s per attempt)
# - Phase 2: temp_max 10.0 → 12.0 (higher exploration)
# - Phase 2: replicas 8 → 6 (fewer schedules for speed)
# - Attempts: 256 → 512 (2x population)
# - Memetic: mutation_rate=0.06, local_search=150 (unchanged from Run 2)
