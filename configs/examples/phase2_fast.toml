# Phase 2 Fast Configuration - Diversity-Focused
#
# Strategy: Lower iteration count with higher temperature range for exploration
# Use case: Maximize GPU population diversity through varied annealing schedules
#
# Expected: Faster per-attempt (6K vs 10K = ~14s vs ~24s), more diverse 41-color
# baselines that give memetic more material to work with
