# Phase 2 Precise Configuration - Quality-Focused
#
# Strategy: Full iteration count with tighter temperature range for precision
# Use case: Thorough annealing to potentially hit 40-color GPU baseline
#
# Expected: Slower per-attempt (~24s), higher quality solutions, potential to
# break 41-color GPU baseline barrier
