Since the onset of the pandemic, many SARS-CoV-2 variants have emerged, exhibiting
Open access substantial evolution in the virus’ spike protein1, the main target of neutralizing
Check for updates antibodies2. A plausible hypothesis proposes that the virus evolves to evade antibody-
mediated neutralization (vaccine- or infection-induced) to maximize its ability to
infect an immunologically experienced population1,3. Because viral infection induces
neutralizing antibodies, viral evolution may thus navigate on a dynamic immune
landscape that is shaped by local infection history. Here we developed a comprehensive
mechanistic model, incorporating deep mutational scanning data4,5, antibody
pharmacokinetics and regional genomic surveillance data, to predict the variant-
specific relative number of susceptible individuals over time. We show that this
quantity precisely matched historical variant dynamics, predicted future variant
dynamics and explained global differences in variant dynamics. Our work strongly
suggests that the ongoing pandemic continues to shape variant-specific population
immunity, which determines a variant’s ability to transmit, thus defining variant
fitness. The model can be applied to any region by utilizing local genomic surveillance
data, allows contextualizing risk assessment of variants and provides information for
vaccine design.

used to define fold resistance to cross-neutralization (FR; that is, factor
of decreased antibody potency), conferred by mutational differences
between lineages at amino acid positions relevant to antibodies of
an epitope class (top right). This information is combined with the
mutational profiles of the distinct lineages (top panel) to compute ‘
fold resistance maps’ to cross-neutralization between any pair of
lineages (x, y) for each epitope class (left, second panel from top).
Asterisks (for example, XBB.1*) indicate spike pseudo groups; that is,
the group of lineages with identical mutations in the spike protein
(for example, identical to XBB.1, in the case of XBB.1*). Antibody
pharmacokinetics (right, second panel from the top) after antigen
exposure are then combined with the fold resistance maps to compute
the temporal profiles of virus cross-neutralization between any pair
(x, y) of immunity-inducing variant x and another variant y. Finally,
these variant-resolved immune waning dynamics are combined with
the timeline of infection (lower right panels) with distinct variants in
any region of interest, to compute the relative number of susceptible
